# Christofides TSP Approximation

The Christofides algorithm gurantees a path of at most 1.5 times the optimal TSP tour

## Usage
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp
./a.out

## Input Format
Enter one integer N denoting the number of vertices in the graph
On the next N lines, enter two doubles representing the geographic coordinates of each vertex

## Output
The program will output the order of vertices visited and the total length of the path.
