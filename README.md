To run the program, either a) open the project in an IDE and run or b) run the following commands in the terminal:
    $g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp
    $./a.out

Program input is formatted as follows:
    The first line contains an integer N, the number of vertices of the graph
    N lines with 2 space-separated doubles representing the coordinates of each vertex

Sample input:

10
100.45 23.53
89.03 45.94
38.90 9.43
78.46 98.12
43.00 46.90
154.90 34.69
21.96 89.45
68.25 89.46
65.78 98.23
76.45 89.24

Output Format:
    The program outputs an approximated order of vertices visited and the total length "traveled" to visit each vertex
